# RNG+CoinFlip

Shane Kennedy

Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is another project I was working on when I was learning Vue, although it appears I ditched the idea of using Vue because it was unnecessary (expectedly).

*Random Number Generator*

The random number generator is very simple in how it works. It will take the minimum and maximum numbers that the user wants to generate a number from. It will not work with negative numbers though. Whenever a negative number appears, the output will automatically be 1.

*Coin Flip*

The coin flip was a little different in how I wanted it to work. When I was working on this, I remembered a game I made back in high school. The game implemented the constant rotation of a 3D coin that would flip. To me it made the most sense to try to add a flipping animation to the coin when the button is hit, but I failed horribly at that. From what I remember, I stopped working on this project because I was just doing it for fun and didn't end up finishing it. I would like to come back to this project and get the coin flip working, but unfortunately I don't have a whole lot of time to commit to it.
